Ecommerce becomes more extractive. The surveillance gets broader and the manipulation more subtle.\n\nI built Kinship because I know there's a better way.\n\nWe are, all of us, related. Not in some abstract metaphorical sense — in the deepest biological, ecological, and social sense. We share ancestry with every living thing on this planet. We're embedded in systems of mutual dependence that our culture has spent centuries pretending don't exist.\n\nTechnology must honor this truth.\n\nI can't promise this will be easy. Building something genuinely different never is. But I can promise you that the architecture is sound, the community is real, and the door is open.\n\nCome build with us.\n\n— David \"Moto\" Levine, Founder",
